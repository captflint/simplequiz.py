# simplequiz.py

A simple study tool.

## Usage

```
python3 simplequiz.py /path/to/cards.txt
```

## Card format

simplequiz expects the cards you want to study to be in a plain text
file, with the sides separated by a colon(:). For this reason it is
important that the data for each side of the card does not contain 
any colons. See examplecards.txt for an example of how cards should 
be formatted.
